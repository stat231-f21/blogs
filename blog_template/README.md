# Checkpoint reminders

## Project plan (Tuesday, November 2)
I will set up the initial blog project repo for you in our course organization on GitHub. The details on your plan for the final blog project should be submitted as a new issue to your GitHub blog repo titled **Project plan**. 

Your plan should contain the following content:

1. Do you plan for your final project to be an extension of the mid-semester project?
  * *If Yes*: Identify specific ideas for how you will extend your mid-semester project. The more details the better here. Do you plan to add additional data? Be sure to include which topic(s) you will incorporate: text analysis, network science, unsupervised learning, and/or spatial data.
  * *If No*: Include details regarding the new general topic / phenomena you want to explore and the questions you hope to address. Identify reasonable data sources and how you will acquire the data (web scrape? download? specific packages? API?).

2. Describe what you hope to deliver as a final product. Will your blog include a published Shiny application? Will it incorporate an interactive map? Will it involve a predictive model that forecasts future values of some quantity using data that you’ve integrated?

3. Outline a schedule for your group's progress that will take you from now (ideas phase) to final blog post and presentation at the end of the semester. During the last project, we had specific checkpoints for different phases of the project. Based on what you envision for your final blog post, identify checkpoints for your group and dates by which you plan to reach those checkpoints. Hold each other accountable, so you’re not waiting until the last minute to do things! In particular, you should have at least one checkpoint each week (ideally two) identifying what work you expect to complete by then.

## Status update 1 (Tuesday, November 9)

Reply to the **Project plan** issue with an update. In this update, you should provide details on the progress you’ve made and whether or not you’ve achieved the work you expected to by this point in your group schedule. If you’re behind schedule, adjust your checkpoints and come up with a plan to get back on track. Consider why you got behind schedule: were you unable to dedicate as much time to this project as you had hoped to? Or did something in the project take much longer than you anticipated?

## Status update 2 (Tuesday, November 16)

Reply to the **Project plan** issue with a second update, following the same instructions as your first status update.

## Blog post (Final version due Wednesday, December 9)

A nearly final draft of your blog post is due by the time of your oral presentation. You may decide to make updates to your blog based on the questions and feedback you receive from your peers after your presentation. The final blog post is due by 5pm ET on the last day of the semester.

Your blog post should tell a data science audience about your project, why they should care about it, and what you have discovered. Assume the readers/audience will be people like you---current or aspiring data scientists. Keep in mind this audience is extraordinarily diverse in terms of skills and abilities, but you may assume some level of familiarity with introductory-level computer science and statistics. 

Although not required, a Shiny application may be included in the blog post if it would be useful to your project. 

Your blog post should make it clear to me and any other student in the class which methods and techniques you have used to produce your finished product.
